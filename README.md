# UserProfile

The project is under development.

User profile is first part (1/3) of backend service bundle that will be part of custom framework for 
integration with any application that will need user registration with all of the following security (SSO, tokens, two factor authentication (2FA), etc).

User profile (and others) will be built as microservices and consumers will configure which parts suit their needs.
The idea is to create flexible boundle that can work with any application on any platform with any use case.
